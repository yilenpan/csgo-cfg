If you are doing these things stop

-Don't start shooting before on target and drag the spray.

-Don't crouch immediately when going into a spray

-Don't crouch with multiple people on screen

-Don't jump around when you miss unless there is somewhere to hide

-Don't quickswitch after reloading

-Don't stop shooting between targets if you have committed to the spray

-Stop shooting only if your spray can recover before you are on the next target

-Tap and burst wherever you can. Spray close range only if they are alone

-Conserve ammo as if you have to kill every enemy on the server with your one magazine

-Always have the mindset that you have to ace or else you will lose. Don't rely on teammates to finish off the round

-Dont blame your team for yourself getting killed, even if you were killed from areas your team was watching.

-Pugs are tests of personal skill, if your team fails, you can still clutch, if you don't you are not as good as you think you are.

-Every round is winnable, don't act like its a throw away round, think of every time you won a full save

-You can beat better players, even pros, just put yourself at an artificial advantage with flashes and gay angles.

-Throw your grenades before you die, even if wastefully

-If better players keep pushing and killing you just molly them off, don't try and fail to out aim them

-If you have toxic players on your team, do not match their toxicity, and DO NOT block them, get them on your side, agree with them, they will play better.

-Don't .block players during the game, just block them in game. If you .block them you cant unblock them for an hour, and they can't hear you. Just use the in game so you can change your mind mid game, or just .block them after the game if you still care.

-Do not be overconfident if you are better than the enemy, you will play more risky and give the shitters an advantage, or they could get lucky.

-Treat every game like it will be a challenge and that it will be difficult, if you don't take it seriously it will reflect in your play.

-Be positive to your team, befriend them, have a laugh, they will play better when happy.

-If you have a streak of losses, just shrug it off, past games and past rounds shouldn't effect how well you play in the next.

-If you have a low score during the game, it does not mean you will not do well in the next round. Anytime is a good time to get back into the game.

-Treat your team how you would like to be treated. If they fail say nice try, if they hit good shots say so, keep the team positive.

-Don't talk about past rounds if it isn't helpful. Don't talk about a failed clutch or missed shots.

-You are the only common denominator in losses. Don't blame losses on bad teams.

-You can never have done enough, pretend you have to kill all 5 or you will lose.

-Don't give them a chance to clutch, kill them all yourself.

-Don't go for a 1 for 1 trade if you are CT it doesn't help

-If you aren't doing incredible this very second, help your teammates instead.

-You only died to that awper because you missed them.

-Don't crouch walk when shooting, it doesn't effect accuracy that much but it moves your crosshair from where it started.

-Don't ever crouch when shooting at bad players, they are not aiming at your head in the first place, they are shooting at your middle. If you crouch you gave a noob a free headshot.

-Don't taunt the enemy team, they will do it back later

-Play on cl_mute_enemy_team 1 so you don't receive taunts

-Watch your own losses, to see why you got gayed.

-Do not be intimidated by higher ranks, there are bad players in A+ too.

-Plant the bomb in a place that your teammates can stop the defuse.

-Do not plant if your teammates are not on site with you

-Don't queue for a pug if you don't think you are going to play well, take a break, or warmup more.

-Don't yell at your teammates for making small mistakes, they know what happened and you aren't helping.

-Do not bait your better players, bait your lit or bad players.

-If the enemy knows where you are stop walking after making noise unless you are leaving.

-On most angles on CT, don't hold first contact angles, hold run out angles.

-You don't have to be fighting the enemy for them to be nervous of you, just harass them and the rotaters from a distance and don't get killed.

-If your awper misses a shot do not say anything along the lines of "never awp again" it can lose you the game

-Don't force buy unless it makes sense to. Don't force if you are down rounds, wait for a solid buy

-Do not walk at a straight angle in relation to your teammate and an enemy line of fire, don't get collated.
